## Description:

Right Rating is a site dedicated to providing more descriptive ratings than those you find on most review sites. Trying to determine the trustworthiness of a site based on the number of stars can be frustrating, since the rating often takes into account graphic quality and reliability, which may not be the specific qualities that a user needs to know. To correct this, Right Ratings splits the ratings into categories designed to help viewers make the right decisions for them.

Because raters can rate on what they know, and decline to rate on things that they don't know, users can skip over sections that they aren't prepared to vote on, increasing the quality of our ratings. It also allows more people to rate their favorite sites, since someone who is an expert in graphics, but not the content of the site can also voice their opinion, without skewing the rest of the data.
